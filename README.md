## PhD Thesis Template for LyX and LaTeX

This repository hosts the PhD thesis template used by doctoral students of Centre for Intelligent Systems, TalTech.

Choose your preferred format:

- `lyx` -- this folder contains the files for LyX UI for the LaTeX system.
- `latex` -- pure latex version which is made by exporting `latex` from the corresponding `lyx` files. NB! Use `pdflatex` to render.

See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for learning about recent changes.

Developed by Dr. Aleksei Tepljakov from his original PhD thesis published in 2015.
